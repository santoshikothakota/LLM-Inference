# 🧠 Local LLM Inference using llama.cpp

This project demonstrates how to run Large Language Models (LLMs) locally using **llama.cpp** and **llama-cpp-python**, without relying on cloud APIs.  

The goal of this project is to understand the internal workflow of LLM inference and implement a privacy-focused AI system that runs entirely on a local machine.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Large Language Models are often accessed through cloud APIs. In this project, the model runs completely offline using quantized `.gguf` files and CPU-based inference.

This approach ensures:
- No external API dependency
- No data sharing with third-party services
- Reduced operational cost
- Greater control over model execution

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/santoshikothakota/LLM-Inference.git
cd LLM-Inference
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Download a GGUF Model

Download a quantized .gguf model file (e.g., Mistral 7B).

Update the model_path variable inside run.py:

model_path = "path_to_your_model.gguf"

4️⃣ Run the Application
python run.py
